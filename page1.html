      <p>The child has one intuitive aim: self development. He desperately wants to develop his resources, his ability to cope with a strange, complex world. He wants to do and see and learn for himself through his senses and not through the eyes of an adult. He becomes a full person. He is educated.‚Äù</p>
     <h2>Why us?</h2>
     <img src="pic/elem3.jpg"/>
      <p>All Lower Junior classes are taught predominantly by their form teachers and teaching assistants within their own classrooms. The exceptions are Games, French, ICT, library and music, all of which are taught by specialist staff. Swimming lessons also begin in Reception once a week at York Hall swimming baths, taught by qualified swimming teachers.</p>
